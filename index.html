                            <h5 class="card-title">Online Shopping Website</h5>
                            <p class="card-text">The Online Shopping Website is an e-commerce platform designed to provide a seamless shopping experience for users. It allows customers to browse products, view detailed product information, add items to their cart, and complete purchases with a secure checkout process. The goal was to create an intuitive and visually appealing site that supports a wide range of products and payment methods.

                                My Role
                                As the primary developer, I was responsible for both the frontend and backend development of the site. This included designing the user interface, implementing the shopping cart functionality, integrating with payment gateways, and ensuring that the site is responsive and user-friendly.
                                
                                Technologies Used
                                Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React
                                Backend: Node.js, Express
                                Database: MongoDB
                                Payment Integration: Stripe
                                Other Tools: Git, Docker, Webpack
                                Key Features
                                Product Catalog: Users can browse a wide range of products, filter by categories, and search for specific items.
                                Product Details: Each product has a detailed page with images, descriptions, pricing, and reviews.
                                Shopping Cart: Users can add products to their cart, view the cart contents, and update quantities.
                                Secure Checkout: Integrated with Stripe for secure payment processing, including options for credit/debit cards and digital wallets.
                                User Accounts: Customers can create accounts, manage their orders, and track their order history.
                                Responsive Design: The site is optimized for desktops, tablets, and smartphones to ensure a consistent shopping experience across devices.
                                Challenges and Solutions
                                One of the challenges was implementing a responsive and dynamic shopping cart that updates in real-time as users add or remove items. I used React’s state management to handle cart updates efficiently and ensured that the cart was fully functional across different devices and screen sizes.
                                
                                Another challenge was integrating with Stripe for payment processing while ensuring security and compliance with industry standards. I followed best practices for handling payment data and used Stripe’s secure APIs to manage transactions.
                                
                                Results
                                The online shopping website successfully launched and has been well-received for its user-friendly interface and smooth shopping experience. It has supported over 5,000 transactions in the first three months and has received positive feedback from users for its ease of use and reliability.</p>
